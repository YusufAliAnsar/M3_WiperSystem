## M3_WiperSystem

## Introduction

Wiper system is automatically ON during the time of rainfall. The senor is fixed in the vehicle glass. The conductive (Touch) sensor is used in this project. It senses the rainfall and giving control signal to the control unit. The control unit activates the wiper motor automatically.

## Components Used

Stm32

The STM32 family of 32-bit microcontrollers based on the Arm® Cortex®-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users. It offers products combining very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, low-power / low-voltage operation, and connectivity, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.
